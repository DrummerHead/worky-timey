# Workey Timey

Simple Ruby script for Time Tracking

Edit `timesheet.rb` to add work, set your rate and currency on `calculate.rb` and then just `ruby calculate.rb` to get a markdown formatted console output.

Works nicely with [loggy](https://github.com/DrummerHead/best-gists/blob/master/loggy), which outputs work done according to git commits on a particular repo.

Work in progress, suggestions welcomed!
